# Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks that explore various aspects of Neural Networks (NNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Each notebook is designed to provide a detailed exploration of different algorithms, techniques, and their applications in deep learning.

## Notebooks Overview

### 1. [Neural Networks Introduction](./NeuralNetworks_Vinyas.ipynb)

This notebook provides an introduction to Neural Networks. It covers the basics of NN architectures, including feedforward and backpropagation algorithms, with practical examples and implementation.

### 2. [Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)](./CNN_Vinyas.ipynb)

Focused on Convolutional Neural Networks, this notebook discusses the architecture, working, and applications of CNNs in image recognition and processing, featuring code examples and model training.

### 3. [Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning](./Transfer_Learning_and_Fine_Tuning_Vinyas.ipynb)

Explores the concepts of transfer learning and fine-tuning using pre-trained models to improve the performance of neural networks on limited datasets, complete with practical implementations.

### 4. [Optimization Techniques: Momentum, ADAM, and Gradient Descent](./Momentum_ADAM_GD_Vinyas.ipynb)

Delves into optimization algorithms used in training neural networks, including Momentum, ADAM, and traditional Gradient Descent, illustrating how these methods can accelerate convergence and improve training stability.
